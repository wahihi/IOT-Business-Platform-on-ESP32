# IOT Business Platform on ESP32

## Overview
An open-source platform that provides free infrastructure including CI/CD, FOTA, and data analytics for developers starting IOT projects based on ESP32.

## CI/CD Pipeline Test
This is a test source code to verify proper functionality of the CI/CD pipeline setup. As an initial test, we implement a basic "Hello World" example to ensure the build and deployment processes are working correctly.

### Test Overview
- Basic ESP32 initialization
- Serial output "Hello World" message
- LED blink functionality as visual indicator
- Continuous monitoring through serial port

### Expected Results
- Successful compilation
- Proper firmware flashing
- Serial output confirmation
- GitHub Actions workflow completion
